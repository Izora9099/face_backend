# Face Backend Project

## Overview

This project is a Django-based backend application. The purpose and specific features of the application will be detailed here. (TODO: Add a more detailed project description)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* Python (3.8 or higher recommended)
* pip (Python package installer)
* virtualenv (for creating isolated Python environments)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

### 1. Install Python

If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure that Python and pip are added to your system's PATH.

You can verify your Python installation by running:
```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

**On macOS and Linux:**
```bash
# Install virtualenv if you haven't already
pip install virtualenv

# Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/your/face_backend

# Create a virtual environment (e.g., named 'venv')
python -m venv venv
# or
# virtualenv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
# Install virtualenv if you haven't already
pip install virtualenv

# Navigate to your project directory
cd path\to\your\face_backend

# Create a virtual environment (e.g., named 'venv')
python -m venv venv
# or
# virtualenv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
You'll know the virtual environment is active when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

### 3. Install Dependencies

This project uses Django. Install it using pip:
```bash
pip install Django
```
(TODO: If a `requirements.txt` file is available or created, replace the above with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### 4. Apply Migrations

Once Django is installed, apply the database migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## Running the Development Server

To start the Django development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
By default, the server will run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You can access the application by opening this URL in your web browser.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

*   **`face_backend/`**: This is the main Django project directory.
    *   [`face_backend/settings.py`](face_backend/settings.py): Contains all the project settings, such as database configuration, installed apps, middleware, static files, etc.
    *   [`face_backend/urls.py`](face_backend/urls.py): The main URL configuration for the project. It includes URL patterns from other apps.
    *   [`face_backend/wsgi.py`](face_backend/wsgi.py): Entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.
    *   [`face_backend/asgi.py`](face_backend/asgi.py): Entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers.
*   **`core/`**: This is a Django app within the project. (TODO: Describe the purpose of the 'core' app).
    *   [`core/models.py`](core/models.py): Defines the database models for the `core` app.
    *   [`core/views.py`](core/views.py): Contains the view logic for handling requests and returning responses for the `core` app.
    *   [`core/urls.py`](core/urls.py): URL configurations specific to the `core` app.
    *   [`core/admin.py`](core/admin.py): Registers models with the Django admin interface.
    *   [`core/apps.py`](core/apps.py): Configuration for the `core` app.
    *   [`core/migrations/`](core/migrations/): Directory storing database migration files.
*   **[`manage.py`](manage.py)**: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways (e.g., running the development server, creating migrations).
*   **[`db.sqlite3`](db.sqlite3)**: The default SQLite database file used for development.

## Key Components

(TODO: Elaborate on specific models, views, and important functionalities. This will require inspecting the code in `core/models.py`, `core/views.py`, etc.)

### Models
(Located in [`core/models.py`](core/models.py))
*   (TODO: List and describe key models)

### Views
(Located in [`core/views.py`](core/views.py))
*   (TODO: List and describe key views/endpoints)

### URLs
*   Project-level URLs are defined in [`face_backend/urls.py`](face_backend/urls.py).
*   App-level URLs for the `core` app are in [`core/urls.py`](core/urls.py).

## Creating a Superuser (Admin User)

To access the Django admin interface, you'll need to create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password. You can then access the admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.

## Running Tests

To run the automated tests for the project (if any are defined in [`core/tests.py`](core/tests.py)):
```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Deployment to Production

Deploying a Django application to production involves several steps and considerations beyond the scope of the development server (`runserver`). Here's a general outline:

1.  **Choose a Web Server:** Use a production-grade web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.
2.  **WSGI/ASGI:** Configure your web server to communicate with your Django application via WSGI (e.g., using [`face_backend/wsgi.py`](face_backend/wsgi.py)) or ASGI.
3.  **Static Files:** Configure serving of static files (CSS, JavaScript, images). Run `python manage.py collectstatic` to gather all static files into a single directory.
4.  **Database:** Use a robust production database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) instead of SQLite. Update [`face_backend/settings.py`](face_backend/settings.py) accordingly.
5.  **Security:**
    *   Set `DEBUG = False` in [`face_backend/settings.py`](face_backend/settings.py).
    *   Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in [`face_backend/settings.py`](face_backend/settings.py).
    *   Set a strong `SECRET_KEY` and keep it confidential.
    *   Use HTTPS.
6.  **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information (like `SECRET_KEY`, database credentials) in environment variables, not in the codebase.
7.  **Process Manager:** Use a process manager like Supervisor or systemd to manage your application server.

Example with Gunicorn:
```bash
# Install Gunicorn
pip install gunicorn

# Run Gunicorn (replace 'face_backend.wsgi' if your project name is different)
gunicorn face_backend.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

(TODO: Add more specific deployment instructions if a particular platform or setup is intended, e.g., Docker, Heroku, AWS).

## Contributing

(TODO: Add guidelines for contributing to the project, if applicable.)
Example:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Create a new Pull Request.

## License

(TODO: Specify the license for this project, e.g., MIT, GPL, etc.)
